The Lightbringer Series is a high fantasy series with a magic system focused on converting light into a physical substance known as luxin. The characters are interesting and the moral dilemmas compelling. The series explores self-discovery, growth, truth, God, religion, war, goodness, and all the tricky stuff in-between. There are a number of big twists and even for the expert trope guesser the books take some turns that just cannot be anticipated. There are plenty of adult themes, but the book doesn't use them gratuitously. You feel both the story and the characters develop quite a bit over the series and even though there are 5 books, they went quickly. The audio book narration is also top tier for book listeners. I have both read and listened to the series in its entirety.
