title: Daniel Shaefer''s Fiction Recommendations and Condemnations
description: This is a fairly comprehensive list of the all the fiction books I can recall reading over the past 20 years (since college). I have categorized some lists for easy recommendations as well as listed the series I barely remember, and for the sake of completeness I have left in all the books that were terrible so that hopefully I can save you time and trouble. I am firm believer that what is a great book to me might not hit all the right notes for you, so feel free to see which ones hit for you and which don't. Hopefully, that is where all the categorization might help you.
