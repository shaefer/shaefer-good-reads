title: Daniel Shaefer's Fiction Recommendations and Condemnations
description: This is a fairly comprehensive list of the all the fiction books I can recall reading over the past 20 years (since college). I have categorized the lists for easy recommendations. I have also listed the series and books I barely remember. Finally, for the sake of completeness, I have even listed the books that were terrible, so that hopefully I can save you time and trouble. I am firm believer that what is a great book to me might not hit all the right notes for you, so I've started to add my descriptions of what I liked about each book or series. Hopefully, that and the categorization might help you find some books you love as well.
